 - No advertising of products or services
   - This excludes linking to other repos, articles, blogs and discussing other open source projects - we :heart: open source
 - Swearing/cursing is allowed to a reasonable degree provided its not intended as harassment as per our [Code of Conduct](https://invertase.link/oss-meta-coc)
 - Please keep library specific discussions to their appropriate category and topic e.g. `React Native Firebase` > `#i-need-help`
 - When asking for help ensure you provide as much info as possible about your issue  e.g. platform(s), versions, error stacks etc - you'll most likely get an answer quicker
